# AtBSwP
Working through Automate the Boring Stuff with python as a reference for my students if they want it

Welcome newbie friends!

Includes (or will include, provided I check this is ok) a copy of AtBSwP with my notes in it as a pdf alongside the exercises in the book for reference. Pretty sure Al S open sourced this book under some license somewhere, will check before putting it up. If not, I'll pull out my annotations into a notes file that cooresponds to the book and people can buy and reference it as they see fit.
